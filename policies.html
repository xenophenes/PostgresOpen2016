            <h3>Conference Policies</h3>

            <p>PostgresOpen is a non–profit, community–run conference series in the United States focused on business users, database professionals and developers of PostgreSQL, the open source database.</p>
            <p>While we do our best, even as a non-profit, we need certain policies to ensure that the event can make budget and be enjoyed by all.</p>

            <h3>Purchasing and Refund Policies</h3>

            <p>Technocation, a 503(c) non-profit, underwrites Postgres Open. Purchasing of tickets and tutorials will be done via the Postgres Open payment gateway transacted by our partner Adyen. Purchasing transactions may take up to 48 hours to appear on purchaser’s credit card.</p>
            <p>Payment through the Postgres Open gateway is completed with PCI-DSS (2.0) level security compliance and all customer data is stored encrypted. </p>
            <p>Due to hotel contracts and our obligations to our sponsors, PostgresOpen can only offer full refunds to the conference up to 30 days prior to the event.</p>
            <p>Refunds will be issued directly back using the same payment method through which the ticket was purchased (eg: credit card).</p>
            <p>Please allow 10 days of processing time for refund requests. To inquire about a refund please email treasurer@postgresopen.org.<br>
              Please include the following in your request:

            <h3>Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>

            <p>This policy is based in large part on this <b><a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment">example policy.</a></b>
            <p>PostgresOpen is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.  Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>
            <p>Conference participants violating this policy may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.  It is the sole discretion of the conference committee if any action is considered to have violated this policy.</p>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing, photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  Failure to comply will result in sanctions and/or ejection from the conference without a refund.</p>
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to: warning the offender, expulsion from the conference with no refund, and/or referral to appropriate authorities.  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff, including anyone on the conference committee, immediately.</p>
            <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.  We value your attendance.  Decisions regarding appropriate assistance will be at the sole discretion of the conference committee.</p>
